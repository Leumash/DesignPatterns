# Template Method Pattern Definition

The Template Method Pattern defines the skeleton of an algorihm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of algorihm without changing the algorithm's structure.

# Intent

The intent of the Template Method Pattern is to define the outline of an algorithm, but then let subclasses do some of the work. This way, the algorithms individual steps can vary, but the overall structure is the perserved.
